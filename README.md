**Customer & Sales Data Analysis**

A data-cleaning and exploratory analysis project using Pandas and NumPy to understand customer behavior
revenue patterns, and sales trends.

**Project Overview**

This project loads customer and sales data, cleans and prepares it, merges both datasets, and computes key
business metrics such as total customers, revenue by country, and order frequency.

**Key Findings**

1. Customer Base
2,627 unique customers in the dataset
Indicates a strong, active customer base


2. Revenue Distribution
The United Kingdom contributes ~£48,600 in revenue
Far higher than countries like Norway and France
Sales are heavily concentrated in one region → dependency risk


3. Order Behaviour
Most customers placed only one order
Low repeat-purchase rate → strong opportunity to improve retention


4. Product Trends
Best-sellers are home décor and small gift products (lanterns, hangers, etc.)
Low-volume but relatively high-value items dominate sales


5. Customer Profiles
Customers come from multiple professions (engineering, healthcare, marketing)
Higher-experience or higher-income groups show higher spending scores


6. Conclusion
Revenue is UK-heavy
Majority of customers are one-time buyers
Product mix focuses on decor/gift items
Growth potential: increase repeat purchases + expand beyond the UK
